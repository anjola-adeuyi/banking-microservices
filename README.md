# Banking-Microservices

The "banking-microservices" app is a modern banking application built using microservices architecture, Spring Boot, and various other technologies for a solution addressed in the banking domain.

This banking management system uses microservices architecture, allowing for scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. It consists of multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific aspect of banking functionality.

## Features

- **Microservice Architecture:** Utilizes a distributed architecture to enable independent deployment and scaling of different components.
- **Spring Boot:** Built using Spring Boot framework for rapid development and ease of configuration.
- **RESTful APIs:** Implements RESTful APIs for communication between microservices, enabling seamless integration and interoperability.
- **Service Registry:** Utilizes a service registry for service discovery and registration, facilitating dynamic routing and load balancing.
- **Config Server:** Implements a centralized configuration server to manage application properties across microservices.
- **Distributed Tracing:** Incorporates distributed tracing for monitoring and debugging microservices interactions.
- **API Gateway:** Implements an API gateway to handle routing, security, and cross-cutting concerns, providing a unified entry point for clients.
